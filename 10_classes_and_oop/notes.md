## Object
- Collection of properties and methods.

## Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

1. Abstraction
- Abstraction means displaying only basic information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only necessary information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background info or implementation.

2. Encapsulation
- In common terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In object-oriented programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.

3. Inheritance
- Inheritance is the process in which two classes have a relationship with each other, and objects of one class acquire properties and features of the other class. The class which inherits the features is known as the child class, and the class whose features it inherited is called the parent class.

4. Polymorphism
- The word polymorphism means having many forms. It is the ability to take more than one form.
